#My Final Year Project
This is my final year project,a simple spam email filter that based on Bayes' theorem.  

Based on Python3 and SQLite3.

Port_stem.py in my project is a modified version of Porter Stemmer Alg. Python version source code and the original version is writted by Vivake Gupta (v@nano.com)  Other programs are my owns work.

To demo my project in presentation, I designed a small website to show the detection result of email classifier with Tornado.

No research value, no study value, mess code style. Just a student project.
