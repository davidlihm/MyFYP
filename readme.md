#My Final Year Project
This is my final year project,a simple spam email filter that based on Bayes' theorem.  

Based on Python3 and SQLite3.

Port_stem.py in my project is a modified version of Porter Stemmer Alg. Python version source code and the original version is writted by Vivake Gupta (v@nano.com)  Other programs are my owns work.

To demo my project in presentation, I designed a small website to show the detection result of email classifier with Tornado.

No research value, no study value, mess code style. Just a student project.

代码风格实在混乱，因为之前一直在用Java，所以初学Python时一时半会也难以改正习惯。但后来的新程序都是用的下划线命名法。
